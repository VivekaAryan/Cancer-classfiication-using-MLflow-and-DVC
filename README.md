### 1. Setting up Initial Directory structure and file
```template.py``` is designed to set up the initial directory structure and files for any project. It ensures that all necessary directories and files are created, making it easier to maintain a consistent project structure.

__Note:__ The ```__init__.py``` file is needed in each folder to turn the directory into a Python package.
